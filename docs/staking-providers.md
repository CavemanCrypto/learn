# Staking Providers

Here is a list of staking providers that plan to support staking into Secret Nodes. 

1. OmniStake. This is a pre-launch Staking Provider that will be running a Genesis Node on behalf of secretnodes.org and stakers from the community. It's being operated by the same team behind secretnodes.org. You can learn more these efforts in our telegram room [OmniStake](https://t.me/omnistake) or by emailing us at pool@omnistake.com.

> If you're a Staking Provider and would like to be listed here, please contact us at hello@secretnodes.org using "Staking Provider Request" as the subject line. Please include basic information about your operation in your request. Team, site URL, and a short blurb about your project.
